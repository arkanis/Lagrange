Changes
=======

- Cleaned up types in the current compiler


What is needed for types right now?
===================================

- Just need type buildins for now. Type definitions are something for later on.
- For now types can only be singular type nodes (IDs, not cexpr).
  - When we encounter a type_expr we just lookup the ID in the current namespace.
    That should return a node with a type component. This node should provide
    everything needed to compile the thing at hand.
  - The result is then stored in the nodes type member.
  - So we just need a type inference pass that takes the type_expr members as
    root and sets every type member further up the tree.


Buildin types and type component
================================

Needed components:

- name: Because the type is something that can be referenced by name.
- type: Contains type information.

Stuff for type component:

- size: Bytes of storage required by this type.
- init: Initial value for new variables of that type.
- load/store: Compiler functions to load a variable of that type into registers or
  store a variable from registers to memory.

Implementation might look like this:

struct {
	size_t size;
	str_t init;
	
	compile_func_t load;
	compile_func_t store;
}

Init could also be list_t(uint8_t). Just a buffer of bytes. But str_t is simpler
since we already have the matching initializer function for it.

And a compile_func_t might look like this:

allocation_info_t compile_func_t(compiler_ctx_p ctx, node_p node, reg_t requested_register);

This signature might also fit for every compiler job at hand. The load and store
functions probably will be called with the var nodes as node argument. But from
the var node we can get the type node of it and the size of the type. So one
generic load function will do for ALU regs and one for SSE regs, etc.


Type system
===========

Types (buildin types, operators) we need for the basic compiler:

- ulong: For normal variables
- ubyte: For strings (byte arrays)
- array: For strings
- Type negotiation rules

Stuff that's needed because every expression has a type:

- function: Function type, can be called. Not sure if we need that to handle
  calls to function definitions. But it's needed for function pointers.
- void: Type of function calls to functions that have no output arguments.
  Just a placeholder for nothing.
- struct: Compound type with multiple members (maybe a base for arrays).
  Return type of functions with multiple output arguments?

Useful stuff while we're at it:

- user defined types: structs with special operators for member and index access

Overview by grouping different types into families:

- all: size, init
- integer (ubyte, ulong)
- array: base, length
- function: address, in types (with flags like optional, etc.), out types (with flags like optional, etc.)
- struct: members (names, types, offsets)
- void


Type definitions
================

Syntax differences:

- In contrast to functions and operators they don't contains code but definitions
  again. This requires different parser stuff.

What they do:

- Variable definitions are used to calculate the total size of the type.
  Also needed to get offset to compile member access nodes.
- Functions and operators are converted to free functions and operators:
  An implicit first parameter "this" is added with the type pointing to the current
  type node. Maybe "this.type" would be a fitting type expression.

Implementation:

- For type definitions we would need another pass first that fills out the type
  component based on var definitions in the type.
  - This might happens recursive. If the type definition uses another type
    definition as member we can resolve that one first.
  - Later on we might need to keep a stack to detect circular dependencies.
  - Dependencies to the own type (e.g. linked list) can be resolved with
    "this.type". But only references or pointers to this are allowed... something
    thats size isn't determined by its content type. Something for later.


"unknown" type
==============

void represents nothing. A "void pointer" instead represents a pointer to unknown data. These are
two different concepts.

Easier to only use "void" internally and use "unkown" to signal unknown memory.

- Maybe we don't need syntax to define something of "void" type. Right now only occurence is when a
  function has no output arguments.
- "unknown" memory also needs a size. So even a ptr(unknown) can't do out of bounds memory access.

This stuff is only needed once we get to pointers...
