# Purpose

To build a bootstrap compiler of Lagrange. It has to know enough of Lagrange so
the first Lagrange compiler can be written and compiled with it. Meaning:

- The quality of code isn't that important. It will be thrown away anyway.
- It's a design playground to test out aspects of Lagrange.
- It's used to test different ways of how the compiler works.

The code is based on a refactored version of the compiler-in-c experiment.
